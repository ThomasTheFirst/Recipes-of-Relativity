Ingredients
Melted butter or margarine, for greasing
50g (1/2 cup) cocoa powder
125mls (1/2 cup) boiling water
125g butter, at room temperature
275g (1 1/4 cups) caster sugar
1 tsp vanilla essence
3 eggs
150g (1 cup) self-raising flour
40g (1/4 cup) plain flour
Icing sugar, to serve 


Preheat oven to 180°C. 
Brush a deep 22cm round cake pan with the melted butter or margarine to grease and then 
	line the base with non-stick baking paper.
Sift cocoa powder into a bowl.
Gradually add almost all the water, stirring to form a smooth, thick paste. 
Stir in remaining water.
Set aside.
Use electric beaters to beat the butter, sugar and vanilla essence in a medium mixing 
	bowl for 1-2 minutes or until pale. 
Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition until combined.
Sift together the flours. Use a large metal spoon to fold the flours into the butter 
	mixture alternately with the cocoa mixture, in 2 batches each, until well combined. 
Spoon the mixture into the prepared cake pan and smooth the surface with the back of the spoon.
Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake 
	comes out clean. 
Stand for 3 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack to cool. 
Serve dusted with icing sugar.
