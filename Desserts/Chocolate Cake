Ingredients
Melted butter or margarine, for greasing
50g 	(1/2 cup) 	cocoa powder
125mls 	(1/2 cup)    boiling water
125g 			 butter, at room temperature
275g   (1 1/4 cups)  caster sugar
1 tsp 			vanilla essence
3 			    eggs
150g   (1 cup) 	  self-raising flour
40g 	(1/4 cup) 	plain flour
Icing sugar, to serve 


Step  1: Preheat oven to 180ï¿½C. 
Step  2: Brush a deep 22cm round cake pan with the melted butter or margarine to grease and then 
		line the base with non-stick baking paper.
Step  3: Sift cocoa powder into a bowl.
Step  4: Gradually add almost all the water, stirring to form a smooth, thick paste. 
Step  5: Stir in remaining water.
Step  6: Set aside.
Step  7: Use electric beaters to beat the butter, sugar and vanilla essence in a medium mixing 
		bowl for 1-2 minutes or until pale. 
Step  8: Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition until combined.
Step  9: Sift together the flours. Use a large metal spoon to fold the flours into rest of the
		ingredients alternating between the butter mixture and the cocoa mixture, 
		twice, then mix until well combined. 
Step 10: Spoon the mixture into the prepared cake pan and smooth the surface with the back of the spoon.
Step 11: Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake 
		comes out clean. 
Step 12: Stand for 3 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack to cool. 
Step 13: Serve dusted with icing sugar.
