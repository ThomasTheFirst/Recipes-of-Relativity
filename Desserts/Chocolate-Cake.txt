Recipe

Chocolate Cake:
Step 1: Preheat the oven to 180 degrees Celcius. 
Step 2: In a 20cm by 20cm square pan/dish, mix together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, and salt with 
	a spatula, making sure it is blended completely. 
Step 3: Add the water, vanilla, oil, and vinegar, and again, mix well. 
Step 4: Scrape the sides for presentation purposes if necessary.
Step 5: Place in oven and bake for about 30 minutes, or until a knife comes out clean. 
Step 6: Cool on a rack completely (2 hours).

Glaze:
Step 1: Near the end of cooking, in a small saucepan, bring sugar, margarine, milk, and cocoa to a boil. 
Step 2: Stir frequently; then reduce heat to a simmer for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. It'll 
	look gloppy, but it's just the bubbles. 
Step 3: Remove from heat and stir for another 5 minutes.
Step 4: Add vanilla, stir, and immediately pour onto cake. 
Step 5: Glaze dries really quickly, so spread it immediately and add any sprinkles now. 
Step 6: Let this cool for an 1 hour, if you can wait that long.
