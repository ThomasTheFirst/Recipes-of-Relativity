Preparation Time: 6 hours 40 minutes
Cooking Time: 50 minutes

Ingredients
1 1/2 cups caster sugar
300ml thickened cream
1 1/2 cups milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
6 eggs


Step  1: Preheat oven to 170°C/150°C fan-forced. 
Step  2: Combine 3/4 cup sugar and 1 cup cold water in a saucepan over low heat. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until sugar has dissolved.
Step  3: Increase heat to high. Bring to the boil. Boil, without stirring, for 5 to 7 minutes or until golden. Remove from heat.
Step  4: Set aside for 2 minutes to allow bubbles to subside. 
Step  5: Pour sugar mixture into six 1 cup-capacity, ovenproof dishes. Set aside to set.
Step  6: Combine cream, milk and vanilla in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring, for 6 to 8 minutes or until small bubbles form at edge of pan. Remove from heat.
Step  7: Whisk eggs and remaining sugar in a bowl until pale and creamy. 
Step  8: Slowly add cream mixture, whisking constantly. Strain mixture into a jug. Divide between dishes.
Step  9: Place dishes in a large baking dish (see tip). Pour boiling water into baking dish until halfway up the sides of smaller dishes. 
Step 10: Bake for 30 minutes or until just set.
Step 11: Remove baking dish from oven. Remove dishes from water. Set aside to cool. Refrigerate overnight.
Step 12: Run a thin knife around edge of each dish. Turn out onto 1cm-deep plates. Serve.


Tip: Place a folded tea towel in baking dish before adding dishes and boiling water. This prevents over-cooking.
